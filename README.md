# Engineering-Portfolio
This is a sample of the engineering work I have done throughout my college career. It is a list collection of school projects, personal projects, and projects for my internships.

School Projects Include:
The Gearbox Assembly (Designed to so the handle raises the nut 6 inches for every turn),
The Lego League Coin (Desgined in SolidWorks for local Lego League competion, used to make silicone mold),
The CNC Turbo (Designed in SolidWorks to take atmospheric presser and inscrease the output pressure)

Internship Projects:
Cuttlefish ROV (A Remote Oerated Vehicle designed to go 30ft underwater and retrieve small objects),
SeaPerch ROV (Improvement of the Cuttlefish ROV, Designed to reset obsticles for SeaPerch Competition),
Motor Shroud (Desgined in SolidWorks, used to mount motors to the PVC fram on the SeaPerch ROV)

Senior Design:
The Mars Mining Robot (Overall Mars mining robot of the the NASA Robotic Mining Competition),
Digging Mechanism (The main mechanism of the Mars Mining Robot, uses bucket chains to dig under the surface to extract regolith),
TIG  Welded Buckets (Self taught myself to TIG weld and added strength to the sheet metal buckets)

Personal Project:
3D Printer Encloser (Made to print ABS without warping and to monitor using Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi),
Humidity Sensor Display (Uses an Arduino Nano, 16x2 LCD I2C Serial Display, and DHT20 sensor to sample humidity and temperature every second),
Steel D20 Project (20 sided dice made out of 1/8" steel with engravings) - Ongoing
